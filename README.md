# ðŸŽ¨ Palettify

**Palettify** is a browser-based color palette generator built for designers, developers, and creatives who want fast, beautiful access to the dominant colors in any image. Drop in a visual, and Palettify extracts its essence â€” delivering a clean palette of HEX codes with animated swatches and instant copy-to-clipboard functionality.

This project is entirely client-side, using the HTML5 Canvas API and `color-thief.js` for pixel analysis and clustering. No servers, no uploads â€” just pure frontend magic.

This started as a one-night build â€” a fast, elegant solution to a common design problem. But it evolved into a tiny design tool with cinematic polish and expressive UI. Palettify is built to feel like a product, not just a project.
